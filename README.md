# üß† SQL Learning Project

This repository contains a set of tasks I completed while learning the basics of SQL.  
The goal of this project is to showcase my understanding of how to query and manipulate data using SQL syntax and logic.

## üõ†Ô∏è What I learned

During the course, I became familiar with key SQL concepts and commands such as:

- **Data selection & filtering:** `SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, `GROUP BY`, `BETWEEN`, `LIKE`, `IS`, `AND`, `OR`
- **Table operations:** `JOIN`, use of `AS` for aliasing
- **Aggregation functions:** `COUNT`, `SUM`, `MIN`
- **String & date functions:** `GETDATE`, `UPPER`, `LOWER`, `DATEDIFF`

**Below, I present practical examples of how these commands and functions are used in real queries.**

### üßæ Task 1: Display the `actors` table sorted alphabetically by surname

```sql
SELECT * FROM actors
ORDER BY surname;
```
